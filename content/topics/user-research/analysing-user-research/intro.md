User research activities produce a lot of raw data, for example:
- written and digital notes
- sketches and photos
- audio and video recordings

Filtering and organising this data will help you to produce meaningful insights.

Follow your [user research plan](../planning-user-research) and keep asking yourself 'What is the problem that the user is experiencing?'

Read [how user research changes](../research-stages/) through the Discovery to Live stages.
