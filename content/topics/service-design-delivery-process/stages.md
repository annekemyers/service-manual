## [3]Stages of the process

The service design and delivery process has 4 stages:

### [2]Discovery

Start mapping the broader service landscape, researching the real needs and problems faced by your users, and understanding the policy intent and technology constraints.

### [2]Alpha

Test out your hypotheses by building prototypes in code to explore different ways you might be able to meet your users’ needs. Explore multiple ideas. Do user research to learn which approach works best and iterate your solution as you learn more.

### [2]Beta

Start building based on the minimum viable product scope you defined at the end of Alpha. Build this as an accessible and secure service. Allow the public to trial the beta alongside the existing service. Use their feedback to improve the service.

### [2]Live

Put the team and processes in place to continue operating and improving the service. Phasing out the old services, and consolidating existing non‑digital channels.
