Your team should feel confident that you are proposing a service that will work in Beta stage. Make sure your timelines, scope and vision match the budget, team and resources you have for the next stage.

If you need a business proposal for Beta stage start on this as early as possible. You can start it as soon as the team is confident it can and should move to Beta. This gives you time to get approvals and avoids the team losing momentum.

If you think you may need a new domain name make sure you understand the [gov.au domain name policies and processes](https://www.domainname.gov.au/domain-policies).

Hold a final demonstration of your Alpha stage prototype with the leaders for your service. Use the demo to show what you have achieved in Alpha stage and explain your vision for the Beta stage.

Hold a final retrospective and make a backlog of epic user stories for the Beta stage.
