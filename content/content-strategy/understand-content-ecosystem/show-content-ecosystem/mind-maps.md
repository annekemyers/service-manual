Mind maps are simple and quick and will show channel complexity and duplication.

Starting with your list of channels, draw a mind map. Draw lines to show the connections between channels.

This will show the state of your content ecosystem.

### [3]Complex ecosystem

If your map shows channel duplication or an overly complex ecosystem, you need a content strategy.
