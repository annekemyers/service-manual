A CMS license refers to the way you will be using your CMS. For those vendors who do require you to buy a CMS license, it's worth asking a few questions up front. They can be difficult to understand and sometimes expensive.

A CMS license includes variables such as:
- number of users and access they need
- number of sites
- types and location of servers
- support and upgrades
- what type of service you'll be getting

Licensing fees may be both up front and ongoing. They may also be subscription based. Ensure you're clear on costs and what your license gives you. Then you can better work out what kind of subscription model or license suits best.
