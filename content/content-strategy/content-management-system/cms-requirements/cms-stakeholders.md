Before you begin, consider who you'll need to have on your team to gather requirements. A broad range of relevant people will help you get a clear idea of what you need your CMS to do. This may include:
- developers
- content designers
- service designers and product managers
- SMEs
- user researchers
- user experience designers
- interaction designers
- SEO experts
- CMS support staff (may be internal or external)
- anyone in your agency who'll be using the CMS to manage content

Also consider:
- what kind of information each user group or person needs
- what platform they use (how they need it delivered)
