The content added to a CMS will impact on the accessibility of your site. Even if your CMS functionality is considered ‘accessible’, the content may not be. This applies to both the frontend and backend of a CMS.

A CMS should also help government agencies meet web accessibility guidelines. See [accessibility](/digital-service-standard/9-make-it-accessible/) in the Digital Service Standard.
