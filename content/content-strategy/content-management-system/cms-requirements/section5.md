Most CMS suppliers offer training and support. Make sure this is included in your CMS license. 

Ask about:
- The cost, frequency and level of support
- If updates include functional releases and security patches? 
- If there will be a delay if your support is based overseas
- How often the CMS is updated and if this affects the content and website?
- Can the CMS integrate third party plugins?
