A CMS will usually have a:
- development or test site – where changes and new features are built and tested
- staging site – a mirror version of your live site which lets you preview pages before they go live
- production site – your public facing live site

A staging and production site may be enough for agencies publishing simple content.

You need to be clear on how your CMS manages changes to keep improving your website. This includes navigation, functionality and new content requirements.

Consider these questions:
- How many development and staging environments do you need?
- How will data and files flow between ‘staging’ and ‘production’ environments?
- How will developers will pull down a production version of your site that's been stripped of personal or secure information?
- Does the CMS put any restrictions on your preferred deployment methods?

### [2]Preview capabilities
The CMS needs to give you an accurate preview of web page content before it goes live. This lets you see what the user will see, before you publish. It will also help you check the flow of content and how the functionality of your website is working.

Depending on how your particular CMS work, you can also send preview links to content owners. This helps them see content before it goes live, so they can provide relevant feedback or corrections.

To test open source CMS, you'll need to do some research. Try asking your friendly developer to install a test site. You can also go to the relevant online CMS forum and ask questions about your CMS there.
