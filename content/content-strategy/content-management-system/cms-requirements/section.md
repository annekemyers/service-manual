Consider the ongoing costs of the CMS. This includes the cost of initial set up, as well as ongoing support and maintenance

The cost of a CMS should be considered from the very start, as many ongoing costs may not be clear. 

**Think about these CMS costs:**
- upfront purchase
- licensing
- training
- upgrading
- maintenance/support
- changes or customisation
- security and hosting

There may be a single fee or separate component fees. Being aware of these will help you make informed decisions about how much a CMS may cost you over time.
