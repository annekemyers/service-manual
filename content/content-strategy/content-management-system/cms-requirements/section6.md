A CMS should provide flexibility in managing and displaying content. Make sure the simple things work well: the CMS navigation tree, searching the content, making simple updates. 

A flexible CMS should work with different content formats, including:
- content pages
- news items
- documents
- map locations
- video
- images
- audio
- data sources, charts and graphs
- forms
- animations
