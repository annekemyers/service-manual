The security requirements of a CMS will depend on the kind of information you’ll be storing in it. Refer also to the [Australian Privacy Principles](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles) and the [Information Security Manual](https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/ism/) for more information and work with your agency privacy and security departments.

If you’re working with sensitive content, check that your CMS provides the security levels you need. 

Also consider **two factor authentication**, also known as 2FA. This is becoming increasingly popular and provides another layer of security. Not only is a password and username required, but a third piece of information. This could be a physical or digital token, known only by the user, which is also needed to log in to your CMS.

You should also develop a data disaster recovery plan and be able to regularly backup data.
