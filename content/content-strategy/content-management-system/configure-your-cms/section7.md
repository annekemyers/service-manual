WYSIWYG stands for 'what you see is what you get'. This is the default kind of content editor for a CMS. It is sometimes also called a rich text editor. You should configure your WYSIWYG text editor to follow your own agency’s style guide.

The CMS text editor should instruct writers about style and format. Some examples include fonts, colours, sizes, heading styles and metadata.

You may also refer to the DTA [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/) for more on this.

Editing features should support content writing. Limit the editor to basic styles and features of the style guide. Too many options makes it easy to create content that doesn’t follow the style guide. 

The editor should support accessible images. You will also need to specify the image formats and file specifications that the CMS will accept.

Talk to your developer to find out how reliable and secure the text editor is, and if you need to use HTML.

Some areas to be aware:
- Potential need for customisation of content using HTML
- Type of code used (ie; open source versus proprietary systems)
- Suitability for everyone who needs to use it
- Compliance with accessibility issues
- Regularity of CMS updates and new versions
- Reliability and compatibility with current technologies and changes
