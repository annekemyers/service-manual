title: Headless CMS using an API
---
A headless CMS distributes content out to various platforms by using an Application Programming Interface (API) service. This means that all content can be created, stored and managed consistently in one place, but sent out to many places.

It’s called ‘headless’ because it doesn’t only publish content to a single traditional website (or head), but to multiple channels.

An API is the middle piece of technology that takes content from your CMS and sends it out to multiple digital channels in the correct format.
