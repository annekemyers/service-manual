### [3] Headless CMS using an API
A headless CMS distributes content out to various platforms by using an Application Programming Interface (API) service. This means that content can be created and edited consistently in one place but sent out to many places.

An API is the middle piece of technology that takes content from your CMS and sends it out to multiple digital channels in the correct format.
