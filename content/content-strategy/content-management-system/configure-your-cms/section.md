Think of your CMS like a service. Its users being the writers, designers, developers and other staff people who will use it to manage content. When choosing or developing a CMS, involve the writers and designers who will use your CMS to help you choose or develop it. This will help you get a clear idea of what you need it to do.

Needs of a CMS: 
- workflow and roles
- navigation tree management
- ability to create, edit, approve, publish and unpublish content
- ability to manage files within the system
- access to support and training

Start with the specific needs of people who will be using the system. How well will your CMS meet their needs? Focus on the needs of the people using the the CMS, rather than extra features that you may not use.
