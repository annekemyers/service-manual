Workflow refers to how you manage content in a CMS throughout the [content lifecycle](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/). 

Aim to keep your workflow simple: write, edit, approve and publish may be enough. If you need multiple levels of checks and approvals, you may want a more detailed workflow.

Document what clearances are needed to publish content  to help you manage and track workflow.

You may be able to connect the  CMS to agency staff directories. This allows you to send notifications for approvals and preview links before publishing.

You need good workflow to use a CMS effectively. Make a list of the people who will be using your CMS and what the overall workflow is.

Talk with your developer when setting up your CMS to support thect workflow.

- How easy is it to set up workflow and follow it in your CMS?
- Does the CMS supports the workflows your agency requires?
- Do you need to supplement the CMS workflow with your own separate system?
- Can users easily log in from other locations?
- What does each person need to do with the content?
- How many active CMS users you can have at a time?
