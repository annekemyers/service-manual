Migrating content means moving content from one platform (CMS or website) to another. The decision to migrate content is a big decision. It is all about careful and safe content management. It also raises questions about the value of content. Content migration needs to be carefully considered before making a decision to go ahead.

If you do decide to migrate content, take the time to create a clear exit plan, assess risks, and put a clear and thorough process in place. Always refer to your [content strategy](/content-strategy/) along the way, so that your actions are in alignment with it.

Badly implemented content migration can result in poor site performance, reduced SEO and poor-quality traffic. It can also impact on the user experience.

There are several questions to ask before you start and to engage all [CMS stakeholders](/content-strategy/content-management-system/cms-requirements/#cms-stakeholders) in the process: 

Answer each of these questions thoroughly.
- Why are you migrating content?
- What content do you need to move or remove? 
- What is the process for moving content?
- How will data be preserved when you move it across?
- Will your SEO be affected?
- Who is responsible for the migration of content?
- What content backups will be made before and after the move?
- How will you know if your content has been successfully migrated and/or stored?
- Who will set up content in the new CMS?
