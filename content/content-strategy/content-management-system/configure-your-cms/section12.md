If you need to change to a different CMS, you'll need a clear exit plan. This involves migrating your content.

Questions for your exit plan:
- What is the process for moving content?
- How will data be preserved when you move it across?
- Who is responsible for the migration of content?
- Will content backups be made before and after the move?
- Who will set up content in the new CMS?
