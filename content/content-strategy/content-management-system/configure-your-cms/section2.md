A CMS helps content teams to work together. You can set up various user roles for your web team in your CMS.

Each of these roles will have a different purpose and access level. Sometimes these roles may be the responsibility of one or more people.

For example, an editor may not be able to publish content. This helps quality control and supports workflow.

Typical CMS roles:
- Author — sometimes called a content creator or writer. This includes preparing and writing content in the CMS
- Editor — edits existing content
- Approver — has the final say on whether to publish a piece of content
- Publisher — pushes content to the ‘production’ site

List who is responsible for each part of the [content lifecycle](/content-strategy/content-lifecycle/). Specify what they will be required to do in the CMS.
