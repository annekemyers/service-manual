Find out how long it takes to make a change on your site. For example, a CMS that can't make quick changes may be a problem. This may have a lot to do with your security requirements and deployment methods. 

For example, find out how long it takes from when a content change is made or a security patch is applied in the CMS, until it is deployed or seen on the front end.

Make a list of editors who need to log into the CMS to make quick changes. If you need to schedule times when you can make changes, plan ahead for this.
