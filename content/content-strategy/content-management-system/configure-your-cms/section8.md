A headless CMS provides a consistent framework for content editors to create and manage content for multiple platforms. It has no front end (or ‘head’) like a traditional CMS, and no traditional ‘view’ functionality.

A traditional CMS manages a single website. A headless CMS is an option if you want to manage content in one place, but send it out to different platforms. These can include platforms such as  mobile apps, custom web pages, widgets etc. This works by using software called an API, which sends out content from the CMS to the different platforms.

Keeping content in one place makes it easy for content editors to manage content on different sites. A CMS may be able to act as a hub, publishing content to many different sites. A consistent tagging system will also define where content will appear on your site/s.

For example, news content can benefit from this approach. A single news item can appear on several related websites by publishing one page in your CMS.
