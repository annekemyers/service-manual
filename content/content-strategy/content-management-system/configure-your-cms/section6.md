Configure the CMS to manage the different types of content you'll be creating. Define sets of default content fields, so they can be applied to different types of content. 

The information entered into your content type fields will affect how your CMS displays content on the front end.

Make a list of the content types you need your CMS to manage.

### [2]Setting field names and help text
A CMS should help you manage content in a consistent way. Use 'help text' to describe what each field is for. This helps authors meet strategic, format and style needs.

Templates and content types used in your CMS will help guide writers by explaining what copy goes in different fields and sections in your CMS.

Help text can contain:
- target audience
- style guidance
- example copy
- number of characters

Use specific and descriptive names for content type fields. Use simple field names to explain which content goes where (for example, event name, event description, main event photo and event booking details) 

Adding useful 'help text' is a simple thing you can do to support people to publish better. Speak with your developer about optimising 'help text' in your CMS. Always display it in a clear way to make it easy to read and understand.
