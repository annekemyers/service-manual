Aim to keep your workflow simple. A simple ‘write, edit, approve, publish’ workflow may be enough. If you do have many levels of checks and approvals needed, you may want a more complex workflow. If you want to manage and track workflow, be clear on what levels of clearances you need for publishing content.

Many CMSs will also offer the ability to connect to your own staff directories. This allows you to send notifications for approvals and preview links before publishing.

Good processes such as workflow are vital to operate a CMS effectively. Make a list of the people who will be using your CMS and what the overall workflow is. Talk with your developer when setting up your CMS. Ensure you have the correct workflow in place for your purposes. 

Consider the following when setting up workflow:
- how easy is it to set up workflow and follow it in your CMS
- if your CMS supports the workflows your agency requires
- if you need to supplement the CMS workflow with your own separate system
- if CMS users easily log in from other locations
- what  each person needs to do with the content
- how many active CMS users you can have at a time
