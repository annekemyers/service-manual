A headless CMS manages content in one place, but the content is sent out to various other places such as a website, a mobile app, digital kiosk etc. This is done by using what's known as an API service. 

An API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's the middle piece of technology that takes content from your CMS and sends it out to its final destination.
