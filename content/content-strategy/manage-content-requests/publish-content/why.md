Publishing teams ensure content works in the platform. They also pick up on any website duplication, broken links or style inconsistencies that have not been previously checked.

For this reason, content leads should keep publishing teams up to date on standards for accessibility, style and usability.

Remember to allow time in the process for publishing tasks to be done.
