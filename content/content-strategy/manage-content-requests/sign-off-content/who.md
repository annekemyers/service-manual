High profile content needs senior-level (or delegated authority) sign off.

Sign-off authority aligns with the accountability of the approver in releasing content to go live. They will be responsible for the strategic alignment of the product, service or content. They will also understand organisational risk.

The content sign-off brief should clearly state what you need the approver to do. For example, review and check for live publishing. 

Ask approvers to give a rationale for any changes or concerns.
