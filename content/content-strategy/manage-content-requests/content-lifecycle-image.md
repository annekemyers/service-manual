caption: The content lifecycle starts with Intent then moves through the following stages; Plan, Create, Sign off, Publish and Maintain/Improve. This process is circular because after content has been published and it is being maintained, it goes back to the start of the process to run through and improve it. In this way we build in continual improvement.

The content lifecycle defines the people, workflow, skills and tasks involved in producing content.

Each content production stage focuses on user needs with checks to ensure the quality and relevance of content throughout its lifespan.
