You may be able to set your maintenance review dates in your content management system (CMS) at the time of creating content. For example, if you have a field to set a review date and a reminder, including the person who needs to be pinged, this can be very helpful.
 
If you donâ€™t have this feature in your CMS, it may be possible to discuss this type of functionality with your CMS developers. If you are considering a new CMS, be sure to include this in your requirements.
