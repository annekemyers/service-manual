Alternatively use a spreadsheet to manually record ownership, responsibility and to schedule review dates. You might like to start by identifying owners for highly strategic content. 

Use the register to schedule the actions you will take to maintain and improve content.

- Record who owns the content.
- Record who is responsible for its its creation and approval.
- Add the date of publishing.
- Add the date for removing (if relevant). 
- Assign the post-publishing content review to someone.
- Set actual dates for its review.
- Note actions to be taken to improve, edit, remove or leave as is.
