Every piece of content, whether new or existing belongs to someone. Working out who owns what content can be a challenge. 

Is it the approver, manager, writer or editor, or does it belong to a team of people? 
Who is responsible for accuracy and currency? 
Who is responsible for its success?

If you canâ€™t identify the content owner, nominate someone else to be responsible for its maintenance and improvement. 

When creating new content, ensure you have a process in place to record who is responsible.
