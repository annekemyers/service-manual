### [2]Content production template
Use the [content production template](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/content-production-template) to check that content is ready for final sign off or to make notes about revisions.

### [2]Readability check
Use tools to check the readability of your content. Aim to make content as readable as possible. This makes it more accessible for everyone, not just users with low literacy. Specialist and technical audiences benefit from plain English too.

It's good to aim for an [age 9 reading level](/content-guide/writing-style/#readability). WCAG criteria 3.1.5 (Level AAA) recommends you [write to lower high school level (Australian Year 7 to 8)](/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-2-0-for-content-authors). Even if you aren't able to achieve an age 9 reading level, the more readable you can make content the better it is for everyone.
