section: Why check content?
---
Checking content at the right time helps to improve the efficiency of your process and influence a quality outcome.

It avoids double-handling when content is sent for sign-off or publishing before it is quality-ready. Timely checks also avoid the build up of content that would otherwise need to be fixed post-publishing–otherwise known as ‘publishing debt’.
