### [2]Content production template

Transfer the main messages from your planning workshop to the [content production template](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/content-production-template/). This will give context for content authors when writing and for reviewers when checking content quality.

### [2]Content decision tree

Use the [content decision tree](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/create-content/content-decision-tree/) as a guide to help decide if your content is right or ready to publish.
