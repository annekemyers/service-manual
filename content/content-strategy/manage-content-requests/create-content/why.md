As a government agency, your content is part of your service to the public. It needs to be user focused. When you champion a user approach you will also be able to focus on improving outcomes and measuring success. 

Set expectations for quality content with your authors. Let them know that quality assurance checks and usability testing are part of the content creation process.

Promote the use of the [Content Guide](/content-guide/) to learn how to structure content, write in plain English and create accessible content.

You will often need to convince subject matter experts of the value of user-centred content. Use your communications and engagement skills to influence and help authors understand how to do this.

Use your [content planning session](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/plan-content/content-planning-workshop) to help your broader team know what you expect to achieve for the business and the user.
