<!-- Preparation --> 
It is useful for a writing pair to include a subject expert and a content expert. This can be one-on-one or in a workshop scenario with several pairs working at once.

If you are working remotely, you can pair write using video conferencing and a collaborative tool such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
