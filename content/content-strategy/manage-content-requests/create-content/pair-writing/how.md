Be clear with your writing partner about:

- how much time you need from them
- the structure of the writing sessions
- deadlines

Let your partner know they are there for their expertise in a certain area. They don't have to be a strong writer.

### [2]Step 1: Start with user needs

At the start of the session you need to outline your user needs and the aim of the content. The aim may include a business need or the subject expert’s objective for the content.

Articulating the user needs at the start will put you both in the same mindset, working towards the same goal.

If you are in a workshop it’s useful to get group feedback on your user needs and content objective.

### [2]Step 2: Outline your roles

One person will be the main writer and the other is the observer. The observer’s role is to study and question the content, looking at:

- jargon — is there a clearer way of writing it?
- user needs — does the content meet user needs?
- meaning — is the content clear?
- style — does the content follow the Content Guide?

You should swap roles so you both experience writing and observing.

### [2]Step 3: Create the content

Write for 10 to 15 minutes and then stop to discuss and review your writing. After this, it’s good to swap roles and start the process again.

If the writer is uncomfortable with an observer watching them write, try giving them space to write and then coming back together.

Keep your sessions to around 1 hour as many people need time to get used to writing with someone next to them. The process is very productive, but quite intensive.
