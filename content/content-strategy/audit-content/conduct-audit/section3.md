Assign a page owner or subject expert to each item in the spreadsheet. To action the audit findings for each section of content, you will need to get that person's agreement. Also make a note if there is no owner for an item.

For maintaining and updating content metadata (such as the page owner), where possible, store this data with the content, within the CMS.
