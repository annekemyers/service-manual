Use a spreadsheet to create a complete list of the above data as evidence about your web pages and other content assets. (For example, images, videos and documents.)

Another option is to export your pages to a spreadsheet from a content management system (CMS) or analytics tool, to give you a complete list of all pages on the site. Remove any content that is not a true page (for example, search result query string URLs) and any pages not included in the content audit.
