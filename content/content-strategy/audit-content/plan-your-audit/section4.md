 Generally, content auditing and analysis is time-consuming. However, it will save time in the long term to know what content you have and how best to manage and improve it.

 The time frame for your content audit will depend on the type of audit, as well as your budget and resources. Full audits across big digital estates can take 6 months or longer. Sample audits on a smaller website can be done in a week.
