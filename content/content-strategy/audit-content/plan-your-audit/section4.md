Your timeframe for a content audit will depend on the type of audit, as well as your budget and resources. Full audits across big digital estates can take 6 months or longer. Sample audits on a smaller website can be done in a week. Generally, content auditing and analysis is time consuming. It will save time in the long term in knowing what you have and how best to manage and improve your content.
