If you choose to reduce the scope of the audit, you can strategically choose areas to focus on.

### [1] Quick wins
A few quick wins will help you to build momentum and motivation. You might focus on:

- news items you published 4 years ago that you can retire easily
- broken links that you can fix
- working with content owners and approvers who you have good relationships with â€” and who may give quick approval for content to be retired

### [1]Changes with the highest impact
To make high-impact changes you might focus on auditing content that has:

- the highest number of page views and the poorest readability
- more than a certain number of page views (for example, all pages that had over 1000 views in the past 12 months)
- been published in the last year
