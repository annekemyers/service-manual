Your website is often the first thing that people notice about your agency and first impressions last.

While expert user research is the preferred method, there are some low-cost ways to get user feedback:
* run a short survey on your website, or ask users for feedback via your other channels (for example, contact centres or on social media)
* if you have access to a pool of users, run a small focus group or short interviews. This will help you understand who your users are and how they experience your website.

To help your stakeholders find empathy with your users, try asking them to find something:
* on your website using the site's navigation menu, and Google or another search engine
* on a similar-sized agency’s website using the site’s navigation menu, and Google or another search engine
