Content audits don’t just make things easier for the end user. They also help people working across the agency.

A content audit can benefit the team:

  * by making it easier for website managers, administrators and content owners to manage content
  * by providing clear evidence for prioritising quality over quantity
  * by helping website owners develop a content strategy — this sets up the direction for more improvements
