Content audits donâ€™t just make things easier for the end user. They also help people working across the organisation.

A content audit can benefit the team:

  * by making it easier for website managers, administrators and content owners to manage content
  * by providing clear evidence to prioritise quality over quantity
  * by helping website owners develop a content strategy to set up the direction for more improvements
