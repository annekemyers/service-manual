To prove the benefits of a content audit you should first show how much your agency can save by fixing bad content.

It helps to highlight what it costs your agency:
* to handle calls relating to the clarification or absence of web content
* to double-handle applications that have been completed incorrectly as a result of information on your site being out-of-date or unclear
* to police and prosecute non-compliance that could have been avoided if people had known what to do
* to manage and maintain your current website â€” and what outcomes your agency is getting for that investment

You could calculate a cost-per-view rate by working out the total yearly cost of managing and maintaining your site. This could include costs for technical development, staffing, and content development. Then divide this total by the number of views you get from users.

If you have data on user satisfaction rates, you could plot the yearly spend against user satisfaction rates and see if there are any relationships or trends.

If you manage content development and publishing using different processes, you could map these out on a process map. This is one way to identify any inefficiencies or blockages in the current process, and potentially remove them.
