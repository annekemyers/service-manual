### [2]Questions to ask

  * To remove: is the content located elsewhere on your site or another agency’s site?
  * To edit: is this content the main source of information? If it’s a duplication of content on your site or another agency’s site, remove it.
  * What content is missing?
  * Are the links working and relevant?
  * Are you publishing content or documents that are on a third party owner’s website? You should link to them rather than duplicate on your site.
