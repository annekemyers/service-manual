Quality content should support a user need when the user interacts with government.

Ask a content expert to evaluate the quality of each content item in the audit spreadsheet. They should assess your content against the following criteria.

### [2]Usability

  * Who is the intended user of the content?
  * Does your content meet a user need?
  * Does the content outline what the user needs to know?
  * Does the content have a clear path to a call-to-action?
  * Is the user directed through the information with scannable subheadings?
  * Are links informative?
  * Can the user find or do what they need to do?
  * Is this the best way to present the information? (For example, is the content outlining a process? If so, would the content be more usable in another form, such as a calculator?)
  * Have you analysed and actioned your user feedback?

### [2]Findability

  * Does the navigation help the user find information?
  * Are the information architecture labels easy to understand?
  * Is the meta description written as a call-to-action using relevant keywords?
  * Is the information found using the siteâ€™s search?
  * Is the information found using a search engine?
  * Is the content in an HTML format?
  * Is the content written using phrases and words your users are likely to use?
  * Does this content link off to credible and authoritative online sources?
  * Is each heading length optimised for search?

### [2]Readability

  * Does the first sentence help users to decide if the page is relevant?
  * Is the content written in plain English?
  * Is the content written in active voice?
  * Is a consistent tone used across the website?
  * What is the readability level of each page? You can use a readability tool to estimate this.

### [2]Accessibility

Ensure content meets [WCAG 2.0 requirements for content authors](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#wcag-2-0-for-content-authors).

  * Is the content written so that all users can read and understand it? Have you thought about people who speak English as a second, third or fourth language?
  * Are the headings structured?
  * Have you provided meaningful alt text for each image?
  * Have you provided closed captions, audio descriptions or transcripts for videos?
  * Can you turn off closed captions in videos?
  * Does the link text identify the purpose of the link?
  * Is the content responsive to mobile devices?
  * Do you need documents or PDF formats or can they be condensed into web page content?
  * If you do need documents or PDF formats, are they made accessible and accompanied by an HTML extract or description?
  * Are any images decorative? If so, consider removing them.
  * Are data tables formatted using table headers and captions?
