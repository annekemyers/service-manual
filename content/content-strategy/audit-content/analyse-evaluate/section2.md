Use data from web analytics tools to measure, rate, test and evaluate content. This can include things like pageviews, bounce rate, page referral, search referral, new versus returning visitors, and user feedback.

Review the analytics provided by site search. If users are looking for specific content on your site and not finding it, you may have a content gap. This could be either because it doesnâ€™t exist or it is not findable. It may also show a need to update how you have written and where you have published content.
