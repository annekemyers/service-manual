In other cases, you may recommend archiving the content. You will then need to decide on the best way to retain the content for archiving. The tasks involved may vary, for example:
  * removing the archived content from the information architecture
  * storing the archived content in soft copy so that it is available for freedom of information (FOI) requests
  * grouping the archived material on new or existing pages to retain online access

Add ‘archive’ as a task to the audit spreadsheet as you go. Follow [these steps to archive content as a Commonwealth record](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-strategy/remove-content/archive-record-content/).
