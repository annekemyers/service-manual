Some content will need reworking. Think about this as you’re analysing the content.

You can make your content clearer by:
- rewriting in the active voice
- reducing the number of words
- rewriting in plain English, which will improve readability and accessibility
- updating the information so that it is current and accurate
- making the content task-focused by including a call-to-action

Add ‘rewrite’ as a task to the audit spreadsheet as you go. You can use the [writing style guidance](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/) in the Content Guide to improve your content.
