A valuable outcome from your audit can be a recommendation to remove out-of-date or inaccurate content so that it is no longer searchable. This may include content sections, pages or assets that do not need to be archived.

Add ‘remove’ as an action to the audit spreadsheet as you go. You will need to follow [these steps to remove content](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-strategy/remove-content/) from your website.
