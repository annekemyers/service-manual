When reporting your findings to stakeholders, you can use the data to frame problems. Show your data as percentages. For example, you could say: ‘45% of our online content is out of date’.

You can use diagrams and charts to help you to present the current state.

Once you have stakeholder agreement, you can start to action your audit. For each content item, you may recommend removing, rewriting or archiving the content. Update your audit spreadsheet to reflect these recommendations.

Example findings to report:
  * how much of your website content is user focused
  * any information architecture or navigation problems
  * how much inaccurate or out-of-date content there is
