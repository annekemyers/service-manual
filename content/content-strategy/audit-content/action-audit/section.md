Use your data to frame problems. Show them as percentages, for example ‘45% of our online content is out of date’.

You can use diagrams and charts to help you to present the current state.

Example findings to report:
  * the amount of targeted content on your website
  * any information architecture (IA) or navigation problems
  * how much inaccurate or out-of-date content there is
