It’s hard to audit content that’s changing.

Putting in place a content freeze during your audit might help you manage the workload. A content freeze restricts what can be changed on the website and whether any new content can be published.

You will need to negotiate the scope of the freeze and any time frames with executives and content owners. Also, be aware of any upcoming publishing that will need to be factored in during your audit. (For example, ministerial announcements or legislative changes.)

An alternative approach is to place a content freeze on your high-profile pages only, and audit those pages as a priority. You can consider auditing the other pages on your site at another time.
