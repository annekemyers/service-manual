A content audit is an exercise where everyone works together towards a common goal — to improve content for the user.

Subject experts can sometimes feel a personal attachment to content they have developed and published. A lot of time and energy goes into writing specialist or technical content.

It can also be a time-consuming task getting reviews and sign-off to publish on a website. As a result, it can be difficult for some people to see content decommissioned, rewritten or merged in with other similar content on the website.

Be sure to empathise with subject experts if you’re working with line areas to conduct a content audit. Make sure experts feel involved, and acknowledge the expertise that each group brings. This will make it easier to work towards the common goal of improving the user's experience.

### [2]Tips for successful auditing

  * Discuss and define roles and responsibilities with the teams involved, so that everyone understands how they can best contribute.
  * Listen to and document any concerns and needs that get raised.
  * Communicate often. Set up regular catch-up meetings to discuss progress. This is also a good way for the wider team to get to know your stakeholders.
  * Work with stakeholders on the main aspects of the audit. This includes setting up any technical work, and the process you’ll follow when auditing the content. You may be able to share skills and knowledge with each other to make things easier and more efficient.
