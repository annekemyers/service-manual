Your audit will have more chance of success if you have an agreed process. Start by discussing and agreeing on roles and responsibilities for the content audit with your stakeholders. For example, find out who has the authority to ensure the quality of content and its ongoing maintenance.

If you donâ€™t know who the stakeholders or page owners are you could run an internal survey. Your survey should ask people to indicate whether they need to have input into specific content.
