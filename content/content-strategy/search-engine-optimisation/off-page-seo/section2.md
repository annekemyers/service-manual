The anchor text of a link is the text that is used within the link. It's the visible, clickable text in a hyperlink.

SEO guidelines for anchor texts:
- Include 1 target keyword of the page that it links to in the anchor text.
- Keep your anchor text relevant to the content of the page it's on.
- Make sure at least 50% of the anchor text (across all backlinks) does not target keywords.
- Use your department or agency name as this can also help with SEO.
