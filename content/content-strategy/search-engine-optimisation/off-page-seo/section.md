Link building is the most common way of optimising for off-page SEO ranking. Relevant links from other websites will improve the content authority of your site.

Some benefits of link building:
- more visibility of your website pages in search results
- more traffic from other websites linked to you (referral traffic)
- links can help in getting indexed in search results quicker

### [2]Types of backlinks
Backlinks come in several forms such as an image or text. You should have more text links than image links.

Link building strategies to get external websites to link to yours:
- other relevant government sites with similar content
- write or produce content for other relevant sites
- public relations — can generate links especially with the media
- leverage partnerships and professional associations for co-linking

### [2]Follow versus nofollow links
By default, all links are ‘follow’ links, unless the attribute known as ‘nofollow’ is added to a link.

The 'nofollow' attribute stops the link from being followed by web crawlers. For example, internal site search pagination. This tells search engines that the hyperlink should not influence the SEO ranking when the page is indexed. 

To do this, it will need to be added into the code of your website where relevant. The 'nofollow' code looks like: <rel="nofollow">
