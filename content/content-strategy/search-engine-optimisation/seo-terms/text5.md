[Metadata](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/on-page-seo/#metadata) refers to different pieces of code often called ‘tags’. This data sits in the background of a webpage. It is usually not visible to users. It tells search engines and other sites about your pages (for example, LinkedIn).

Metadata can help control how search engines find and display your site in their results. The most common types of metadata that affect SEO are page titles and page descriptions. Use keyword research to guide writing metadata.
