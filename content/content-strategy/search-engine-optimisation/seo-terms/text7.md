Backlinks (or inbound links) connect to your content from other websites. Search engines use these backlinks to help rank the quality of your content.

Backlinks may come from:
- other government agencies and departments
- trusted organisations
- businesses
- individuals (for, example a minister’s blog)

There are two components of a backlink. These are the ‘quality’ and the ‘quantity’. You want as many quality backlinks to your site as possible. Search engines read these as examples of the value of your content. If valuable sites are backlinking to your content, it shows that your content is valuable. 

You want the backlinks to use the keywords that your users are searching with.

### [2]Link checking
Don't forget to regular check your own page links. Broken links can affect the usability of your site which in turn will affect your SEO.
