The main search results are **organic results** (sometimes called natural results). These appear in a ranking order of highest to lowest. The only way to improve your ranking position is through better SEO.

In the organic results, you may also see a:
- local listing for local businesses
- featured snippet or rich answer
- knowledge box â€” with [schema](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/seo-terms/#schema) containing more specific information.

**Paid results** are the paid advertisements before and near organic results.

Paid ads are not affected by your site's SEO. You can buy adds through Google's AdWords or Microsoft's Bing Ads.
