 SERP stands for search engine results page. These are the search results a user sees in a list, after they’ve done a search.

In a typical search, you’ll see both paid listings and organic listings. The SERP page will consist of 10 organic results. Each result will have at least:
- headline — known as a meta title or page title
- description — known as a meta description
- URL — the website page link itself

You can directly influence these 3 pieces of information to get better search results.

Some SERP results can also include extra information called [rich snippets](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/on-page-seo/#rich-answers): 
- navigation
- website headings
- names of people
- search bars

These may appear if your pages have been set up to maximise SEO.
