Don't just use text only. Images can help improve your SEO. Search engines reward the use of consistent, relevant visual formats to support text. This in turn also improves the user experience.

You'll find more guidance on SEO and images in the [DTA Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/search-engines/#on-page-optimisation) including use of ALT tags and captions.
