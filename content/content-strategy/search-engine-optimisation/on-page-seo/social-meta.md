#### [3]Social meta tags
Other types of metadata are social meta tags such as:
- Facebook Open Graph: refers to tags you can use on a web page which can be read by social platforms to show the user more relevant content.
- Twitter card markup: this is when a person tweets a link to your content and other content is automatically attached. This can include photos, videos or other media.

These tags are placed in the `<head>` section of the source code on the web page where you want this to appear.

Whilst these tags don't directly increase search enging rankings, they do make your content more shareable and clickable. This makes for a better user experience and also attract links from other websites to your content.
