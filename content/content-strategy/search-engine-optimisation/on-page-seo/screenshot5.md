### [3]Sitelinks Searchbox
A Sitelinks Searchbox helps users search and link more specifically to pages in your site, straight from the organic search result. 

This image shows a search result including a sitelinks search bar (results from nsw.gov.au), under the main description.

It's possible to configure your SEO so that a search box may appear within a search result. You can do this using [schema](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/on-page-seo/#schema).
