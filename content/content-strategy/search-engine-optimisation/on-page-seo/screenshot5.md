A [Sitelinks Searchbox](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitelinks-searchbox) helps users search and link more specifically to pages in your site, straight from the organic search result.

This image shows a search result including a sitelinks search box (results from nsw.gov.au), under the main description.

It's possible to configure your SEO so that a search box may appear within a search result. You can do this using [schema](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/on-page-seo/#schema).
