### [2]Title tag / page title
**Title tags**, also known as page titles, are one of the best ranking factors you can affect. Page titles are also used in browser history and bookmarks.

Page titles should always be unique. No two titles on a site should be the same. They should provide context or describe content in an accurate way in search results.
