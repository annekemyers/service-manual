Internal linking helps search engines understand the structure of your website, the topics and themes of your content. The keywords used within the anchor text (the actual words you link to) also play a valuable role. They help search engines work out the relevancy between pages and the importance of a page, by the quantity of internal links pointing to it. 

When you create internal links across your site, aim to:
- link to relevant and important pages on the site
- use descriptive keywords in the anchor text to give a sense of what the link is about

### [2]Internal site search
Internal site search is the search that users do on your site. This can also improve user experience. Google Analytics shows search terms to its Adwords customers, so internal search may be your best source for search terms.

Think about how you can apply external SEO to internal search. Keep track of the relevant keywords and search terms people are using on your site. Use the internal search functionality in your CMS and site analytics.

Search engines also use a person's browsing history, location and cache to generate search results.
