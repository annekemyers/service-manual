A URL is the actual web address of each page on your site. Use words in the URL to help users find your content and search engines understand what your page is about.

**Guidelines for writing URLs:**
- Use keywords in your URL.
- Keep URLs short but clear.
- Make sure you use a consistent, clear format across all URLs.
- Avoid special characters such as & or %.
- Use verbs where possible (for example, use -apply instead of -applying
- Use hyphens (-) to separate words, not spaces. 
- Use keywords in your URL structures (folder names).

URL structure may be dependent on how your [information architecture](/content-strategy/information-architecture/) has been set up.

### [3]Google and HTTPS
Make sure your CMS will provide secure protocol URLs (HTTPS). Google may lower the search result position of URLs that use HTTP. [Secure your site with HTTPS](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en) from Google support has more on best practice HTTPS.
