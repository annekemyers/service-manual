Social posts can help to show Google that you are a trustworthy and legitimate website. Though they may not show up in search results, the traffic they generate creates a strong SEO signal.

If you have social media channels with relevant content, link out to them from your website. Also make sure that those channels are linking back to your site.

Many government agencies use multiple social media channels. These include: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn. Use your social media channels to help your SEO.

Blog pages are also a useful way to build your online presence and improve SEO. For example, see the [DTA blog](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/).
