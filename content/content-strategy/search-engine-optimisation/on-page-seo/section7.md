Schema are code snippets that help search engines understand your webpage better and rank it more highly. This is also known as a tag, microdata or [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).

You can use this type of data to also add your business address, link to a map, contact information, location or description of your service.

Schema enhances the way web pages appear in search results. This can impact on CTR (click through rates), which also affects the ranking of your pages.

[Schema.org](http://schema.org/) also provides a shared markup vocabulary that is accepted and readable by many search engines.

**Search result enhancements include:**
- business information such as location and contact information
- marketing information — name, logo, and social profiles 
- sitelinks searchbox — allows users to search your website directly from Google
- breadcrumb navigation — shows the page's position in the site hierarchy
