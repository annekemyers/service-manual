Rather than trying to optimise your whole site at once, focus your SEO strategy on a page by page basis. SEO works better when itâ€™s targeted. 

Be specific about where you want people to land when they come to your site from search. Do you want users to land on specific pages or are you happy for them to land anywhere and find their way around?

Good SEO happens when you focus on user needs. Clear page titles, subheadings, backlinks and keywords all help to improve SEO.

Planning your content will help users to find top level information. It will also help search engines understand the main purpose of your pages.
