Rich answers are also called featured snippets. They show above the organic search results in their own box.

There are 3 types of rich answers:
- paragraph
- list
- table

You may improve the chances of being a featured snippet by:
- optimising your on-page SEO
- creating content that answers specific questions

Make sure your web page answers many similar questions. Try to avoid turning your answers into an FAQ page. One option may be to create a [people also ask](https://moz.com/blog/infinite-people-also-ask-boxes) box.
