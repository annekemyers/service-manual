Duplicate content is when the same content appears in more than one place on a website. The same content may appear both on your own website or on an external site. Content that is the same on different pages or sites will affect your SEO rankings.

Approaches for dealing with duplicate content:
- Rel=canonical tag — tells a search engine that you know content had been  copied. It also tells the search engine that the SEO weight should pass to the original page.
- noindex meta robots tag — add this to the HTML head of each page that you do not want search engines to index.
