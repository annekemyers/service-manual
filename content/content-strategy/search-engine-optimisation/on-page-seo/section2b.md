### [2]Meta description
The meta description tag gives a summary of the content of a page for search engine listings. Use some of your main keywords but make sure the description reads naturally. Address the need of the user and the intent behind their search.

Good meta descriptions encourage users to click your listing. Think of the meta description tag as your marketing copy or call to action.

See the DTA Content guide for [guidelines on writing meta descriptions](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/search-engines/#on-page-optimisation).
