Use heading tags to reinforce a pageâ€™s most important themes.
Search engine robots generally place the most weight on an H1 tag followed by H2, H3 and so on.

**Guidelines for writing headings:**
- Use keywords within headers.
- Every page should have a H1 header.
- Do not use headers as links.
- Do not use headers to style font on the site.
- Only use headers for new blocks of content.

See the Content Guide for more on writing [headings and subheadings](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/content-structure/#headings-and-subheadings)
