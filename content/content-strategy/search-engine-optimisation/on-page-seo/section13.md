With over 80% of Australians now owning a mobile phone, you should consider mobile use in your SEO strategy. Google may penalise you with poor search results if your site is not mobile friendly.

For example, government apps such as [mygov](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwif1bmbgrjWAhVONbwKHaxaApcQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.gov.au%2F&usg=AFQjCNEefvEQZBR1Fc6Ty9olnDoURUCP7g) are now used by more people on mobile phones. Always aim to include SEO for mobile in your content strategy.

Content should display well on mobile and tablet. It needs to be easy to read on any device, so that users can access your information.

Think about how to support multi-devices from intention through to launch and beyond. This strategy can also help you to reach more users.
