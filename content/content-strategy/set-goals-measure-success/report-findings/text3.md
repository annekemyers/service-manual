Set up a monthly reporting template with a dashboard that shows performance against the KPIs. Keep it short and the important part here is not so much the metrics themselves, but the analytics and tracking performance against KPIs. It's the findings that are most important for senior executives and the wider content team.

When appropriate, consider reporting content performance to:
- your direct team
- the IT team
- content owners across the agency and also the leaders of their branch
- the senior executive team
- the public
- other agencies
