Learn which metrics to use and how to interpret your website’s analytics. The power of data is in cross referencing. For example, using ‘time on site’ might show that visitors are not spending much time on a page. This could be a good result showing that users are finding what they need. Or it could show the content is not meeting user needs and they are bouncing (leaving) the page quickly.

Following are some examples of metrics you can use.

### [1]Average session duration
Find out how long users are spending on the website per visit. This is a good indicator for how relevant the website is for user needs.

### [1] Content cost
An effective way to show the value of your content strategy is to calculate the cost of production. Savings can be made by developing good processes and content.

### [1] Desktop and mobile
Find out how many visits are from desktop and mobile devices. Also find out which devices are used.

### [1] Failure demand
A badly designed website could cause increased demand for other services (referred to as failure demand). The reason is that users might need to phone or visit because their needs weren’t met on the website.

### [1] Pages per session
Find out how many pages are visited per session.

### [1] Pageviews and unique pageviews
Unique pageviews tells you how many times the page was visited by separate users. You can also see the total number of pageviews and unique pageviews for the whole site. If a user visits a page 3 times it’s counted as 3 pageviews and 1 unique pageview.

### [1] Referral sources
Show where traffic is coming to the website from. It can include other websites, intranets and social media channels.

### [1] Search terms
Find out what search terms are used to bring users to your website. You can find out search terms typed into search engines and also used within your site.

### [1] Site performance
Site performance includes metrics such as page load times and instances of users reaching 404 pages (broken or dead link).

### [1] Top pages
Find out the most visited and least visited pages. This gives you a good indication about what content is found and used.

### [1]Visitors

Find out the number of users visiting your content. You can also filter this by new and returning visitors, and also filter out internal visitors.
