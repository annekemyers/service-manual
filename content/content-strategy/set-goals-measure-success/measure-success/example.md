### Did you know?
#### The cost of online transactions
A recent [study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/Economics/deloitte-au-economics-digital-government-transformation-230715.pdf) shows that the average cost of an online transaction is 40c.  This compares to $6.60 for a telephone call, $12.79 for a postal transaction and $16.90 for a face-to face visit.
Use these figures to show the importance of getting online transactions right.

(These are Deloitte Access Economics calculations based on three international sources for government channel costs and their consultations with government).
