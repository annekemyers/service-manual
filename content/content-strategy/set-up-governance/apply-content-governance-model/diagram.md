This model has the least content maturity. Subject experts create and publish their own content. They may also send their signed off content to a publishing team. This model can indicate a basic content maturity level with little or no strategy.

**Pros**: Faster content approval and publishing.

**Cons**: Managing content is localised. For example managing content in a business area rather than agency-wide. There may be a tendency to put business needs before user needs. It’s often impossible to oversee quality standards such as plain English, readability, and accessibility. It’s difficult to establish overall editorial consistency.
