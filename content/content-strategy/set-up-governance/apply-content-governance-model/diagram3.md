A hybrid content governance model works to improve content and efficiencies across extended teams. The central team’s focus is on high profile content meeting its strategic goals. The team ensures the quality of published content. They own the site's information architecture.

Other lower profile content, such as a careers section, may be decentralised. These teams could create and edit their own content, but not be able to add new pages. Depending on resources and their content expertise, they may be able to publish their own pages.

**Pros**: Lines of accountability and ownership extend from leaders to doers and specialists. This gives structure to specialists in extended teams.

The subject expert informs and defines the ‘what’ and the ‘why’. The content expert knows about the ‘how’ and the ‘where’. This creates a strong workflow, using content types and quality checks.

**Cons**: There needs to be strong governance and commitment from leaders. Without this roles and responsibilities can become unclear, and resources stretched. This model can be difficult to manage. It needs a lot of maintenance, communication and coordination.
