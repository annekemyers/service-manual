### [3]Content tasks and skills workshop
Download the [content tasks and skills workshop activity (1.4MB PPTX)](/assets/files/content-strategy/content-tasks-skills-workshop.pptx ) to use with your immediate or broader teams. Invite a mix of people who plan, create, check, test and remove content. Ideally, run this workshop during the planning content stage.

Use the power point presentation to work through the following activities.

#### [2]Roles
Keep the list of role ideas visible on a screen during the exercise to help kick-start the activity. It’s best not to use job titles.

#### [2]Tasks
Keep the list of tasks visible on a screen during the exercise to help with thinking.

#### [2]Skills
Articulate all the possible scenarios. For example, we need these skills in this content lifecycle stage. You can apply several skills for each lifecycle stage.

#### [2]Gaps
Identify gaps using red dots. At the end of the exercises, ask the participants to add red dots to any of the post-it notes to identify any gaps.

#### [2]Putting it together
- Merge post-its into categories
- Define a user story that sums up the need for each category group, for example:
As a … (who) we need to (what)... so that we can (why)...
- Define an overarching problem statement
