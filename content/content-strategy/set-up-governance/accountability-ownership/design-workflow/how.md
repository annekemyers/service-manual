You may wish to improve the workflow of one business area. Invite people from the different stages of the content lifecycle stages. 

Run a current-state discovery to help find out existing interactions and progress your content maturity. You are looking to improve on bottlenecks and to ensure quality checks.

Give your team an overview. You want to discover and visualise a clear and efficient way to work together during the content lifecycle. 

### [2]Current-state workflow
Map out the stages of the content lifecycle across a wall or whiteboard. Use post-its or a marker to write headers of the stages.

Use the wall space to sketch out the flow of tasks between each stage. Ask your team to contribute by adding post-it notes under each of the lifecycle headings. Lead the group to:
- identify who the people are in each task
- allocate time frames for each task
- pay attention to your checks and revisions
- note guidelines and standards that you'll apply
- identify outputs for each stage
- note any blockers for a successful workflow and discuss how to improve.

### [2]Future-state workflow

Apply your current state findings to your new bespoke workflow. Start with what works well and progress to fix any blockers or improvements.

Your workflow should reduce complexity and increase efficiency. Allow time for checks (quality and accuracy) and revisions before sending for signoff. Signoff may be in a document or in CMS staging.

Prepare a users and roles sheet:
  * add columns for: name, title, email
  * add columns for business owner, manager, reviewer(checker), author, publisher
  * use this as a guide to start on your diagram
