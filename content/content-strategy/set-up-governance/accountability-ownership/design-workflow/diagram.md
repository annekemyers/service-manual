imageAlt: Content production workflow shows roles and tasks
caption: With your your content lifecycle and content roles in place, you can map out the tasks in your workflow. Tasks relate to who is doing them and at what stage in the lifecycle they happen. Each role aligns with a relevant task across the content lifecycle stages. The content production workflow also shows the interactions between tasks along the way.

Add each of the roles as vertical labels.

Write up life cycle stages across the top of the workflow:
- intent
- plan
- create
- check and revise
- sign off
- publish
- maintain and mprove
- remove

Draw up tasks for each role across the swimlanes under the relevant life cycle stages.

Chart the interactions between roles.
