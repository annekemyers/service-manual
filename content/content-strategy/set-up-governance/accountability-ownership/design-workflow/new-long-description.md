**Stages of the content lifecycle**

Stages display horizontally on the top of the workflow from left to right: Intent, Plan, Create, Check and Revise, Sign off, Publish, Maintain, Remove

**Roles**

Roles display vertically on the left: business owner, content manager, quality checker, subject expert/content writer, publisher. Each role aligns with a relevant task across the content lifecycle stages. 
 
**Workflow tasks**

Each task displays adjacent to a relevant role and under the relevant life cycle stage. 

- Tasks begin with ‘request’ by the business owner under the Intent stage.
- ‘Request’ points to ‘user/business needs’ by the content owner under the Plan stage. It then proceeds to  ‘content brief’.
- ‘Content brief’ points to ‘draft’ by the subject expert or content writer under the Create stage.
- ‘Draft’ points to ‘review by the quality checker under the Check and revise stage.
- ‘Review’ also points with a dotted line to ‘revise’ by the subject expert or content writer. The dotted line implies draft.
- ‘Review’ points to ‘sign off brief’ by the content manager under the Sign off stage.
‘Sign off brief’ points to ‘sign off’ by the business owner under the Sign off stage. 
- ‘Sign off brief’ also points directly to ‘staging’ by the publisher under the publish stage. This implies that it does not need senior sign off.
- ‘Sign off’ points with a dotted line to revise and also to ‘staging’.
- ‘Staging’ points to ‘publish’ by the publish under the publish stage.
- ‘Review’ under ‘maintain/improve’ points ‘review’ and ‘revise’ by the content manager.
- ‘Archive’ under ‘remove’ points to ‘publish’ which implies published content that needs to be removed.
