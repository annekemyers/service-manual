Websites are Commonwealth records. There are rules about how you manage major changes to government websites.

For major updates, or when you [decommission a website](/content-strategy/remove-content/decommission-website/), youâ€™ll need to keep a copy of the website. This is a legal and business requirement.

For minor updates that only affect a few pages, you may be able to use your CMS. 

The records and information management people in your agency will be able to inform you about requirements. They will also know how long you'll need to keep content.

They should work with you to create an [Information Management Plan](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/).
