There are several ways to ensure your website has been captured as a record.

## [2]Check with the National Library if theyâ€™ve stored your website

The National Library of Australia (NLA) might do this. This will be a snapshot of your website as part of the [National Library's Australian Government Web Archive](http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/) (AGWA). This meets Commonwealth archival requirements. You'll need to consider saving a copy for your business purposes. 

If the site you want to remove content from is not archived with the AGWA, contact them. Ask if they will capture it in their next website harvest: recordkeeping@naa.gov.au. Under special circumstances would they capture a website on request.
