## [2]If your website is not stored with the National Library
Youâ€™ll need to send a copy of your website to the National Archives. You can use tools such as [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/), or similar software. These tools will snapshot your website for sending to the National Archives. 

You may need to contact your ICT area to ensure that local HTML files work properly. If you have any questions please contact the Archives via the [Agency Service Centre](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/support/agency-service-centre/index.aspx).

You do not need to include linked objects that are separate from the website. For example, transactions and datasets.
