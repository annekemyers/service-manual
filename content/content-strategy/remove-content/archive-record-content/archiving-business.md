Your agency may need to keep a record of the versions of content. If so, you should use a recognised information management system such as a CMS.

The best ways are either:
A content management system (CMS) or 
electronic document record management system (EDRMS).

If you can't capture your content in a recognised information management system, you'll need to find another way.

### [2]If you're only making a minor change
Capture your website content and manage it in your CMS or EDRMS from the point of creation. This makes sure you're able to make changes to content but also meet government record requirements.
