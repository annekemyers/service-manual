This step is more for major updates. You won’t need to do this step for minor updates.

In your plan, mark who is responsible for approving each of the removed pages and document their agreement.

Agree who is responsible for each step. This includes:
- technical requirements
- communication (both internal and external), 
- archival, 
- content management and 
- risk management.

Core people you’ll need to talk to are: 
- Content owner: reviews content for removal 
- Information and records manager: 
- Owner of the archiving policy, as they'll be able to tell you how long content needs to stay
- IT: implements technical aspects, such as redirects
- Comms: they will communicate any decommission messaging
