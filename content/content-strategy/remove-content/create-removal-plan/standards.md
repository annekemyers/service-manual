As you start this removal plan, itâ€™s good practise to think about longer term strategy. 

You can negotiate standard removal periods for common types of content, such as media releases or industry notices. For example, you might retain content for current year and previous 2 years. this will help to avoid a large backlog of content.

Publish your time frames to remove content amongst your team. This will help you to initiate regular content reviews and to negotiate removal periods.
