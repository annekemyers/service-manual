Evidence will become clearer after your [content audit](/content-strategy/audit-content/). Some things you can use when you start to scope the need for removal are: 
- using analytics to show the state of the content
- checking that the content has a user need
- checking that content supports business goals
- analysing the costs

Showing the content owner the duplication that’s currently on the website, can help. You can do this in a few ways: 
1. Screenshot the relevant content and the conflicting information 
2. Ask the content owner to find a typical task using your digital service. Try to use a task with content they don’t own. This way they’ll learn how to operate the current system.
