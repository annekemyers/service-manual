Users have the right to request government information at any time. This is part of the [Freedom of Information Act 1982](https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/).

Information can often stay online because of a fear of a Freedom of Information (FOI) request or legal action.

If information is archived currently, it can still be accessed at any time by your agency. This may involve contacting the NAA. You might also be able to access older content from your CMS. Removal from the website does not mean there's an FOI risk.

The number of FOI requests can often be minimal. So you can use this number in your evidence for removal.
