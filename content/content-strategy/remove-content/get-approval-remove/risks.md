section: Identify the risks if you don't remove content
---
The audit will also contain potential risks if you choose not to remove certain content. This includes content that is:
- outdated
- not current
- the wrong information
- not optimised for search engines
- on a page thatâ€™s never visited
- a bad user journey

These risks can result in people having a bad user experience of your website. This can also negatively affect your reputation as an agency. The risk of providing people with incorrect information can lead to many problems for users themselves. This will result in a decline in trust between your service and your users.
