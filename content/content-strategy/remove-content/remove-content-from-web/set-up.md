Redirects prevent users from finding pages that no longer exist. They direct users to a new and relevant page of content. As part of the removal process, make sure:
- you give users options to continue their search for information
- your website keeps its search engine optimisation (SEO) rankings
- your website looks maintained

Talking to your Information and Communication Technology (ICT) department is the usual process. Provide them with the list of your deleted URLs and new URLs you’d like to redirect to. Add the date to go live, so the redirect process doesn’t happen before you remove content.

When redirecting, you should consider the user journey and SEO, pointing people to the information that’s the most relevant.
