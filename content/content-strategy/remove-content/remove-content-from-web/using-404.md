### [2]Using 404 and 301 pages
404 pages show an error message on the screen when a website address canâ€™t be found. Use them only when necessary. It should be easy for the user to understand that the page no longer exists. Give them an obvious search option to find their content.

301 pages are a permanent redirect. In most cases, this is the best method for implementing redirects on a website.
