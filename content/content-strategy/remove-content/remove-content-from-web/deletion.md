Sometimes youâ€™ll need to create a deletion message. This explains the removal of web information and why it no longer exists. Keep the copy clear, simple and actionable.

Add this to your [removal plan](/content-strategy/remove-content/create-removal-plan/) so that you remember to keep users informed.
