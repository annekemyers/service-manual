### [2]Manage changes to contracts or licences
Closing down a website will impact some of your contracts or licences.

Consider conducting an audit of contracts and vendors that support the site that is being decommissioned. Review the scope of contract agreements and licences.

You should also consult with your legal team for advice regarding these changes.
