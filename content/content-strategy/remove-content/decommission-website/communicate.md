### [2]Communicate with stakeholders
When you decommission a website, it may impact many people. You’ll want to make sure that communications are as clear as possible, with as minimal disruption to anyone involved. 


You can minimise risk and fear by communicating clearly and in a timely way.

Consider
- Which groups the activity will affect.
- Have they had opportunity to have input?
- What is the message you’re communicating? Is it clear? Does it communicate your reason why?
- What is the best way to communicate your message?
- Establish working groups or forums before you decommission your website, so you can hear and respond to any concerns
