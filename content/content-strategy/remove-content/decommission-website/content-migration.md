### [2]Migrate content
If you are migrating content to another website, you may wish to consider: 
- reviewing content to ensure that itâ€™s up to date and accurate
- ensuring that you store content correctly in an information management system such as a CMS
- documenting the details of the migration itself
- determining how and when the content will be migrated so that it has the least impact on users
- managing the different content management systems used by the old and new websites
- identifying potential risks such as loss of or damage to content in the transfer process
- key content being unavailable for a period of time
- the use of test, staging and live environments
- a strategy to redirect users to other webpages
- keeping statistics for the old and new locations, to work out the timing of removal of redirections
