### [2]Conduct a risk analysis
What are the risks if any, of decommissioning your website? How will you manage them? Consider things like:
- How much technical support do you have?
- Who will set up any redirects?
- Do you have secure servers in place?
- How will you know if your content has been successfully migrated and/or stored?
- Are there any security risks?
