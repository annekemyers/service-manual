### [2]Identify key links
When you decommission a website, there may be links (internal and external) that still link to the website. If so, you’ll need to let the content managers of those websites know what’s happening. This will give them the opportunity to update their links. You can use a site analysis tool or a search engine for this.

It may also be useful to provide a redirect to the new site. Also consider how long you want the redirection in place. It’s also useful to provide a message to visitors. For example, “if you are not redirected automatically in x seconds, please use the above hyperlink”.
