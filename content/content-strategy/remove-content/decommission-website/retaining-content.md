### [2]Retaining and managing content
You can keep your decommissioned website information in the [National Libraryâ€™s Australian Government Web Archive (AGWA).](http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/). You may also need to send a copy to the National Archives. Remember to use the correct systems for capturing content for the required retention periods.

If your agency can't do this, contact the [National Archives Agency Service Centre for guidance](http://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/support/agency-service-centre/index.aspx).
