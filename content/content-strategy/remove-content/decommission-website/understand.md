### [2]Understand your users
Before you decommission a website, it’s useful to have a clear understanding of your users and their needs. 

You can find this through:
- website analytics and measures of content success
- interviews and focus groups
- usability testing of your website

This will help you to understand how important each user group is to your agency. During this process, you’ll also find out what information if any, can safely be decommissioned.
