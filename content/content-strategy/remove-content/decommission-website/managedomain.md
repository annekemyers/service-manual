You'll need to decide whether you'll keep the domain name, [set up a redirect](/content-strategy/remove-content/remove-content-from-web/#set-up-redirects) or deregister it.

Consider: 
- the profile of the domain name and how well users know it.
- how the URL performs in search engine results for popular relevant search terms.
- if the URL is also in printed form or in online (PDF) publications.

Consider other services may be reliant on the domain name. This includes email, file transfer protocol (FTP) and sub-domain names.

Contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to arrange any redirections.
