<!-- Preparation --> 
Before starting the workshop, research the business areas. Have some idea of what you think the vision and mission of the agency could be.

The workshop will vary depending on what you already know about the business.

Invite all business areas involved in setting needs and goals. Send them an agenda of the meeting. They will need to bring what they think the vision, mission and goals of the agency are.
