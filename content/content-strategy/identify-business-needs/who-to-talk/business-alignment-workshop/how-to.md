Start the workshop with introductions and an icebreaker.  

If you have a clear idea of the vision, mission and goals of the agency, show participants and get joint agreement. 

If you anticipate disagreement, get them to write up the vision on post-it notes. Group the post-its and get agreement. Do the same for the mission statements. You should co-design statements at the same time. 

It might be easier to get into smaller groups if you need to brainstorm missions. 

The goal of the workshop is to get agreed vision, mission and goals of your agency. 

**Props can help facilitate the workshop:**  

- Use a ‘car park’ board to stick post-its with topics of conversation that take your workshop off on tangents. Address these topics at the end of the workshop or follow up on them after.
- Use visuals like the [pyramid diagram](/content-strategy/identify-business-needs/what-business-needs/#the-strategic-pyramid) to get quick understanding — follow the rules for writing vision, missions and goals.
