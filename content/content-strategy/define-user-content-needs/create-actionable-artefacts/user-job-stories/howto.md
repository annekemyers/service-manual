### [2]Step 1: Use pain points to write your stories

Once you have collected your user pain points you can write your stories in response to them. Jot them on an index card so you can visualise and group your stories.

The most common format for a user story is:
  * As a … (who is the user: be as specific as possible)
  * I want to / need to … (what task is the user trying to do)
  * So that … (why does the user want to do this task and what is their goal)

For example:
  * As a young person entering the workforce for the first time
  * I need to know what I should be getting paid (minimum wage)
  * So that I can negotiate/check this with my employer

### [2]Step 2: Start broad, then get detailed

Keep your stories simple, focused, concise and active. Begin with broad stories by focusing on the overall goal. Then gradually break this down to create stories that reflect an individual task.

For example, an overarching story might be:
  * As a content designer
  * I need to create user-centred content
  * So that my content meets a user need

A more detailed task-based user story under this could be:
  * As a content designer
  * I need to understand readability requirements
  * So that my content is clear and accessible to people with low literacy levels

### [2]Step 3: Work out if you need job stories

Job stories can be used when you have the same user/s for each story and your stories are starting to sound repetitive. A job story helps you create more detail.

Job stories follow the format:

  * When … (what situation is the user in)
  * I want to … (what is the user trying to do or need)
  * So … (what is the user’s goal)

For the readability example above, the user is a content designer and the job story could be:

  * When I am creating content
  * I want my content to be written simply
  * So that people with lower literacy levels can understand it

### [2]Step 4: Write acceptance criteria
Write acceptance criteria on the back of your index cards to measure how your content meets a user or job story. When you meet the acceptance criteria you have completed the story.

For our readability example in the user story above, acceptance criteria might be that:
  * content is in plain English
  * content was tested with a readability tool and scored between a Year 5 (around age 9) and Year 9 (around age 13) reading level
  * content is tested for comprehension with users
Acceptance criteria should state a high-level intent, rather than a solution. Use acceptance criteria to test your content and measure performance.
