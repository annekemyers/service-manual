Use your user stories to align the team and work towards the same goal.

Share user stories with stakeholders to remind them of the user need behind the content, and the content’s purpose. You can use user stories to get empathy, trust and buy-in from decision makers.

While you’re creating content, keep referring back to your story map to stay on track and remember what the user needs to know.

Your user story map reflects a broader user journey. It may also show how you can ‘join up’ disconnected or contradictory content across different 
business areas.

Testing may highlight that your user stories or job stories need to be iterated. User needs change, so stories have to adapt to this
