### [2]Step 1: Decide on your user

You need to define the user in your story. You should do this by using evidence from [user research](/topics/user-research/), so the journey is realistic. For example, what they were trying to do, their motivations, and their context before and after the interaction? Do this in every iteration of development. 

Quantitative research is good, but you really need qualitative research. It will give you the insights to how users think and feel through their journey.

### [2]Step 2: Choose the scenario
Define the scope of the experience you are going to map.

For example, this could be a new cafe registering their business. Try to keep your user journey simple. Your map may cover the journey from the initial business plan through to registration and opening the business.

Make sure you define a clear goal for the user. For the example above, the goal would be to register a business.
