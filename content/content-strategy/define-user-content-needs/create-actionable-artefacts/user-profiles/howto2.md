### [2] A user characteristics gauge (in relation to the product or service)
Depending on the nature of the project you are working on, you may like to include a characteristics gauge. This will allow you to easily see the differences between each of your different profiles. The gauge can be a simple line that rates a participant from low to high. You can add the characteristics depending on what is relevant to your project. Here are a few examples.
  * Knowledge or expertise
  * Level of interest
  * Context of interest
  * Breadth of usage 
  * Experience in related task
  * Digital literacy/format preference 

Build on your profile by answering questions about their needs, pain points, risks and motivation.

#### [2]Needs/Tasks
What does the user need to do or find? What tasks do they do which are relevant to your project? The need will be goals that are aligned to an outcome.

#### [2]Pain points
What are the obstacles that prevent them from being able to do the task? Are they being informed well enough? What other factors are preventing them from getting the task done?

#### [2]Risks
What could go wrong if they can’t do the task or find the information? What is the impact of any implication–personal, financial etc.

#### [2]Motivation
Why does the user want to complete the task? How is successful completion of the task going to affect them?
