Communicate your user profiles with the team. Profiles are valuable to ensure that what you are building or designing meets a user need. They are a reminder to your team and to stakeholders of who you are designing for.

User profiles are one part of the toolkit that you can use to communicate your research. You should ensure that you research any design decisions you make based on your profiles. Use other methods to do this, such as concept testing and usability testing.
