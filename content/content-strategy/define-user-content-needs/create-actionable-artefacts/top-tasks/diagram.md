Once you have created your top task shortlist send it out to users to vote. You can do this by emailing a survey to a group of users. Ask them to vote on their top 5 tasks in order of preference.

This exercise will generally reveal patterns and show the most important tasks. It will help you prioritise content development and improvement to make sure users can complete these tasks.
