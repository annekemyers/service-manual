Show your pain points in numbers, for example:

- the number of pages with little or no traffic
- the cost to the call centre for time spent on queries (that could have been solved with good online content)
- what users are searching for on your site that should be there, but isn't. You can find this information through the 'nil search results' data
- analytics on how your users navigate the site and their preferred pathways.

It's helpful to offer memorable bite-sized statistics that show pain points, such as:
- 10% of pages account for 74% of traffic
- 65% of pages not updated for 4 years
- cost of maintaining website 

Once you go deeper to [analyse your content](/content-strategy/audit-content/analyse-evaluate/), some of these facts will become clearer. For now you want high-level facts about your digital estate.
