Show your pain points in numbers, for example:

- the number of pages on your website with little or no traffic
- the cost to your call centre for time spent on queries that could have been solved with good online content
- how often users are searching for something on your site that should be there but isn't. You can find this information in the 'nil search results' data.
- web analytics data showing how your users navigate the site and their preferred pathways

It's helpful to offer memorable, bite-sized statistics that show pain points, such as:
- 10% of your pages account for 74% of your traffic
- 65% of your pages have not been updated for 4 years
- the dollar cost of maintaining your website

Once you go deeper and start to [analyse and evaluate your content](/content-strategy/audit-content/analyse-evaluate/), some of these facts will become clearer. For now, you want high-level facts about your digital estate.
