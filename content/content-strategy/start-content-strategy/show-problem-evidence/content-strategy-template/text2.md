Make sure you put all the outputs of your content strategy into the template. Our [content strategy guidance](/content-strategy) is designed to help you do this.

Some other rules to follow are:

* Start it at the beginning of a project.
* Rebrand it.
* Use it as a working document, adding information as it becomes available.
* Summarise information and link to source material, rather than duplicate.
* Amend it to work in your context — it’s not one size fits all.
* Keep it up to date.
* Share it regularly so that everyone is on the same page.
