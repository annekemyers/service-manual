Set up a governance group so they are involved in creating the content strategy from the start. They should help to steer and monitor progress.

Your governance group is made up of:

- divisional project leader/s
- senior responsible owner/s 
- a project sponsoring group
- a project team to form and maintain relationships with internal stakeholders
- stakeholder working groups that include representatives of both agency and audience needs

Identify and include people in your governance who are:

- decision makers with the most influence. Establish an informal group of senior executives (about 4 people) that you can regularly draw on for feedback and advice. 
- groups that will be affected by changes to content. Include a working group of people in your agency who are involved in the content process. Include content managers, leads and policy people. This will ensure your strategy is able to be carried out.
