Share your pitch with a couple of senior executives first to get their feedback. Try to  understand their key concerns, so you can prepare responses. Tailor your pitch to their concerns and how you will address that.

Engage regularly with your mentor group and your working groups. Set up regular touch points while you are creating your strategy. This will also help with implementing your strategy down the track. 

You may also need to get buy-in from external stakeholders to join up content across government agencies.
