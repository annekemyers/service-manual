Learn what motivates senior leadership to deliver. Look at your agencyâ€™s strategic and business plans. Your content strategy will support those plans.

Show how your agency needs to improve its content to help achieve its goals and to support corporate values.

Find out what works for your stakeholders and tailor your pitch to that. It could be a slide deck, an elevator pitch meeting or a concise email.

Your pitch should be simple and include:

- the opportunity for change
- the need for change (for example, support your case with quotes from user research, case studies, and statistics)
- the need to follow broader government guidelines, such as the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/).
- what you need from the decision-makers (for example, time, money and people)
- what the risks are
- what it will involve (for example, a roadmap with activities, costs and delivery milestones)
