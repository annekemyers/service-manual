Find out the motivations of senior leadership to deliver. Look at your agencyâ€™s strategic business plans. A content strategy will support that. 

Show how your agency needs to improve on content to help achieve their goals and support corporate values. 

Find out what works for your stakeholders and tailor your pitch to that. It could be a slide deck, an elevator pitch meeting or a concise email.

Your pitch should be simple and include:

- the opportunity for change
- the need for change. For example, quotes from user research, case studies and statistics that support your case
- the need to follow broader government guidelines. For example, the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/).
- what you need from the decision makers. For example, time, money and people
- what the risks are
- what it will involve. For example, a roadmap of the activities, costs and delivery milestones
