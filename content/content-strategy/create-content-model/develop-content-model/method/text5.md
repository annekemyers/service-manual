Trial your draft workflow with your teams and keep them up to date on iterations. Make sure you sell the benefits of using a clear workflow.

Seek endorsement and sign off by the senior executive. Once agreed, publish the workflow on your intranet.

Continue to check in with teams to see how the well they are applying the workflow.
