Engage your stakeholders and partners. Your partners will include designers and developers. Make sure to involve them at each stage and get their input. 

They may include:
- content authors
- product managers
- interaction designers
- user researchers
- information architects
- website developers

Involve stakeholders early in the process so you can create a successful model that works for everyone.

For your content model to work effectively, youâ€™ll also need to [define user content needs](/content-strategy/define-user-content-needs/) and [identify business needs](/content-strategy/identify-business-needs/).
