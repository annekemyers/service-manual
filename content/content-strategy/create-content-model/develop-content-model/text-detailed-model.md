A more detailed model will take the conceptual model and add the attributes for each content type.  It will then clearly describe the relationships between the attributes. 

For example, a media release content type will include components such as:
- a heading
- who is releasing it (Minister or agency)
- details of the release
- date
- call to action etc

As part of developing a detailed model, it may be helpful to use a spreadsheet. This is a commonly used method to provide a common language between content strategists and developers. A content model spreadsheet ensures everyone has a clear understanding of the different types of content being used.
