Reusable content can mean two different things:
1. A content type that can be repurposed into different content types.
2. Content chunks that are created once and edited in one place but can be published in many places. 
 
It also means that content should be written in a way so that it can be reused as required, on any other page or part of your website. This will save you designing the same content multiple times.

For example, you can manage content in your CMS, but have that same content displayed in various places on your website, other websites, publications or applications etc.
 
It’s also helpful to clearly define when you want to reuse content in more than one place.
 
To create content types, you’ll need to:
- understand what types of content to meet the needs of your users
- what types of content you need for your business objectives
- define and develop the components and attributes of each content type
