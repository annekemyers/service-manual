To design content types, you’ll first need to [define user content needs](/content-strategy/define-user-content-needs/). This will help you work out:
 
- what content you already have that meets the needs of users
- what types of content you still need to design
- what components and attributes of content types are most helpful for uses.
 
To do this successfully, ensure that you’re clear on the relationships between your content types such as:
- what is the purpose of each type?
- how do the different content types work together to meet the needs of users?

Consider conducting a content audit [LINK]. This can help define what content you want to keep, what you can remove and where the gaps are.
