A content type refers to content that can be reused within a content model. Can be assembled to create new information products. Has a unique purpose, components, attributes and structure.

There are many different types of content used across government. 

Some examples include:
- news item
- media release
- mission statement
- executive bio
- forms
- service (how to’s)

Content types are designed to allow you to use content in more than one place consistently. This is called reusable content. For example, a ‘news item’ content type can be used to publish news consistently in more than one place.
