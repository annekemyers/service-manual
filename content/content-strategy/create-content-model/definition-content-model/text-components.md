### [2]Components
Each content type is made up of components. These are the smaller building blocks or working parts of each type. 

For example, you may have a ‘news item’ content type, with components that include heading styles, text styles, images, dates, author etc.

### [2]Attributes
Attributes describe the component in more detail. For example, if your component is a heading style, the attributes will include what type of heading: is it a H1 or H2, font style, character lengths, keyword use etc

These attributes are also used to configure your CMS fields when creating content. This is so that you can create fast, consistent content that works and looks the same every time.

Content types can also allow your website to do several things with the information. For example, in the case of a ‘news item’ content type’, a user could:
- be presented with all news articles for a certain month
- search for specific news items by themes or categories
- receive news notifications or be added to an email newsletter alert
