A content model can help to achieve a clear, simple and consistent user experience. It helps ensure that content is produced the same way every time. The goal of a content model is to structure content in a way to provide:
- clear, consistent information for users
- detailed guidelines for content designers
- defined parameters and specific guidance for developers
- correct information and data to content management systems.
