Use website analytics to [measure the success of your content](/content-strategy/set-goals-measure-success/measure-success/) and how it has been performing. Good IA relies on understanding the needs of your users and their behaviour on your site. 

### [3]Start with popular content
Popular landing pages can tell you what users are looking for on your site and how your IA is performing. Each page on your website can act as a landing page. Not all users will land on your homepage first.

Use analytics to understand how users interact with your more popular pages. This can help to create an even better user experience. 

There is always room for improvement. For example, you may have a single page that’s very popular, with lots of content on it. One option may be to expand it into a larger section or multiple pages. Or review the content to decide if less content would improve the user experience.

### [3]Move onto least popular content
Use analytics to discover more about your least popular pages and how your IA is affecting them. These are the pages that don’t usually receive much traffic or have high bounce rates. You may need to remove, rename or improve these pages. This may include making changes to your IA.

Improvements to least popular pages may involve adding more useful content and/or relocating content to other pages in the navigation.

### [3]User behaviour flow
Look at your analytics to better understand user behaviour flow. This will show you how users are navigating and moving around your site. Use this information to find out about their behaviour patterns. 

Behaviour flow can also reveal where users are coming into your website from and where they are exiting. Use [Google Analytics 360](https://beta.dta.gov.au/our-projects/google-analytics-government) for a comprehensive view of your users' experience. 

### [3]Search terms
Review keywords people are using to arrive at your site. Think about whether any of these words could be page headings for your IA. This will also improve your [search engine optimisation](/content-strategy/search-engine-optimisation/). For example, if a popular keyword is ‘passport’, use this in some of your main page headings.

### [3]Bounce rates and exit pages
A bounce rate shows when your users land on a page and leave immediately. This data can help to understand why users are leaving your site early. Look at these pages and decide whether to remove or improve them. It may also be the case that users are exiting your website because they have completed their task. 

Consider doing a [content audit](/content-strategy/audit-content/) before working on your IA. This will help you understand what content you have, and what you need to remove or improve.
