This type of content review is all about how your content has been performing. Using website analytics, you can better understand the needs of your users and their behaviour on your site. Good IA relies on this understanding. 

### [3]Start with popular content
Popular landing pages can tell you what users are looking for on your site and how your IA is performing. Each page on your website can act as a landing page. Not all users will land on your homepage first.

Use analytics to understand how users interact with your more popular pages. This can help to create an even better user experience. 

There is always room for improvement. For example, you may have a single page that’s very popular, with lots of content on it. One option may be to expand it into a larger section or multiple pages. This could make the user experience and your IA even better.

### [3]Move onto least popular content
You can also use analytics to discover more about your least popular pages and how your IA is affecting them. These are the pages that don’t usually receive much traffic or have high bounce rates. You may need to remove, rename or improve these pages. This may include making changes to your IA.

Improvements to least popular pages may involve adding more useful content and/or relocating content to other pages in the navigation.

### [3]IA and user behaviour flow
You can also use analytics to better understand user behaviour flow. This will show you how users are navigating and moving around your site. Use this information to find out about patterns of behaviour. 

Behaviour flow can also reveal where users are coming into your website from and where they are exiting. One tool that may also be useful in analysing user behaviour is [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/).

### [3]IA and new sites
If you are building a new website, you’ll be building your IA from scratch. Getting this right is an important foundational step in new website development. 

Some questions to start with include:
- What are the needs of your users?
- How do you want to guide and direct users around your site?
- What types of content do you have? 
- How do you want to structure your menu? 
- What are the top level menu items, followed by sub-level items?
- What should the menu labels be called?

Also consider looking at previous or current site analytics, to help work out what your IA should be for a new site.

### [3]IA and search terms
Review your keywords and think about whether any of these words could be page headings for your IA. This will also improve your search engine optimisation. For example, if a popular keyword is ‘passport’, use this in some of your main page headings.

### [3]Bounce rates and exit pages
Bounce rate shows when your users land on a page and leave immediately. This data can give you understanding about why users are leaving your site early. Look at these pages and decide whether to remove or improve them. It may also be the case that users are exiting your website because they have completed their task. 

Consider doing a [content audit](/content-strategy/audit-content/) before working on your IA. This will help you understand what content you have, before you decide what needs removing or improving.
