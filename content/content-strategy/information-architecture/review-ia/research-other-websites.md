Research can include other Australian government websites, relevant industry sites or international government websites.

Consider:
- if other Australian Government agencies or industry bodies are already filling content gaps with useful content
- whether these are pages you can link to instead of including in your own structure
- how they have structured their content
- how easy or difficult it is to find information? 
- what can you learn about their flow of content. 

Research may also help if you have difficulty deciding or agreeing on specific labels for the IA. In these cases, external research or an objective opinion may be able to help resolve these issues.

### [3]Avoid duplication
Look for ways to reduce duplicate content across Australian Government websites. In some cases, it may be better to link to other government sites to avoid duplication of content. 

When developing a large government website, consider brief information about any related sites on your main website. Then direct traffic across to those sites. This will become part of your link strategy. Where there is a government agency which has similar content, try and meet with them or call them to discuss your project. Aim to agree on how the websites will both relate to each other and avoid duplication.

Develop a website working group within your larger department where you share user research, analytics information, knowledge and strategies.
