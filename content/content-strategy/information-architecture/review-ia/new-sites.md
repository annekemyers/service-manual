If you're building a new website, youâ€™ll be starting your IA from scratch.

Some questions you will need to answer include:
- What are the needs of your users?
- How do you want to guide and direct users around your site?
- What types of content do you have?
- How do you want to structure your menu?
- What are the top level menu items, followed by sub-level items?
- What should the menu labels be called?

Also consider looking at previous or current site analytics, to help work out what your IA should be for a new site.
