Improve your IA to meet the needs of your users. 

Review the results of your testing, fix issues any issues. Once you make the changes, re-test with users. Based on the results, you may need to refine your proposed structures and page titles to better meet user needs.

Improving your IA won’t end once you have tested and validated your IA with users. It’s a continual practice. You may find that you need to make additional changes that weren’t clear until you started drafting. For example, where it would be more useful for the user to read 1 proposed page in 2 parts.

When you have launched your new IA, user feedback will also highlight refinements you need to make.
