Firstly, test the main areas of your IA design by asking users to complete a specific IA related task. This could be as simple as asking users to find a specific piece of information on your website, or use the IA to move around the site and complete a task.

### [2] Example scenario
You (the user) needs to tell Centrelink that your weekly wage has changed. Find out what you need to do. 

Ask your users to complete a specific set of questions relevant to the task. This could be questions like:
- navigate to the Centrelink website
- find the information you need
- describe how you would complete the task of submitting information.


There is no set number of questions/tasks you should include in your testing.

Record and document the progress and results. Be careful not to include keywords from your IA in the testing questions, as this will influence your results.

Be mindful that most people will start to get tired at around 45 minutes.

Sit with the user while they’re completing the test. Ask them to talk about what they’re doing. Make notes about how they try to locate information.

If you’re working with a digital agency, ask if they have a user experience specialist. This person can facilitate the testing. If you can, sit in on the testing as it will give you valuable insights into user behaviour.
