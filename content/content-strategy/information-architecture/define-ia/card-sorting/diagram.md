To prepare cards, get page-level headings/labels from the different sections of your website. 

Write up these labels on index cards of one colour.

Recruit a mix of people from the user groups of your website or site section. You will be testing in pairs. So you may have more than 1 pair in each session.

Ideally, hold the activity in person so you can ask people why they made their choices.

You may need to hold an online session. You can use card sorting software to create a URL of the activity. Then send the URL to your users to do the activity remotely, and send it back to you.
