1. Introduce your group to the context of why this group of specific people are there.
2. Explain the reason for the card sort. For example, you might use card sorting to improve or work out the navigation of a website. The words on the cards represent the menu options/page titles.
3. Lay the cards out on a table in an unorganised way.
