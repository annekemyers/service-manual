Card sorting helps to:
- group items to form your IA
- understand how users would categorise labels
- decide whether to make your IA subject-based, task-based or based on user types

There are different types of card sorting activities. In each instance, you will create the cards first but you or your users may add to them during the process.

### [2]Open
This involves users sorting the cards into groups. There are no limits on the open card sort. New cards can be added at any level of the proposed structure.

### [2]Closed
This involves users sorting the cards into top-level categories you've created in advance. 

### [2]Hybrid
This involves users sorting the cards into top-level categories you've created but they can also create their own. In a workshop setting, you might set a top-level structure but start by validating and refining that with the user group.
