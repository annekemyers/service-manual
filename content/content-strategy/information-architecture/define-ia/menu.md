When mapping out your main menu items, it's best practice to use no more than 7. However, larger sites may need more. Decide this based on the needs of the content and the user. 

Donâ€™t hide something in an unrelated section just to keep the number of top-level sections low.

Try to make your headings stand alone. They should make sense when seen out of context of the whole IA.
