There is no rule about how you should group headings in your IA. Some helpful ways might be subject, task or user types based IA.

### [2]Subject based IA
This involves grouping your information into the subjects you need to cover. For example:
- aged care
- single parents
- families
- residency
- businesses

These examples will be different from agency to agency.

### [2]Task based IA
This involves grouping your information into the tasks a user needs to achieve. For example:
- applying for an ABN
- updating or cancelling your ABN
- applying for other registrations

### [2]User types based IA
This involves grouping your information into types of users. For example:
- individuals
- businesses
- tax professionals etc

Consider using this approach for behavioural rather than demographic groupings. For example, ‘buyers and suppliers’ rather than a demographic such as ‘parents, children, adolescents’. If you are considering demographic groupings, test this out with users first.
