There is no rule about how you should group headings in your IA. Some helpful ways might be by subject, task or user types.

### [2]Subject-based IA
Group your information into the subjects you need to cover. For example:
- aged care
- single parents
- families
- residency
- businesses

These examples will be different from agency to agency.

### [2]Task-based IA
Group your information into the tasks a user needs to achieve. For example:
- applying for an ABN
- updating or cancelling your ABN
- applying for other registrations

### [2]User types-based IA
Group your information into types of users. For example:
- individuals
- businesses
- tax professionals etc.

Consider using this approach for behavioural rather than demographic groupings. For example, ‘buyers and suppliers’ rather than ‘parents, children, adolescents’. If you are considering demographic groupings, test this out with users first.
