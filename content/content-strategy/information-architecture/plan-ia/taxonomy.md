A taxonomy is a list of agreed terms and words that you can use to categorise content across your digital ecosystem. These words can help you decide what labels to use for your IA, as you structure content around it. 

Some general types of taxonomy for IA can include terms like:
- users
- products
- services
- how-to tips
- providers
- publications

Organise your taxonomy into categories and then a hierarchy of related terms to use for your IA. Itâ€™s helpful to know what each term means and what it refers to. 

Use methods like [card sorting](/content-strategy/information-architecture/define-ia/card-sorting) or keyword research to build out your taxonomy. Find out common terms and words from your subject experts and business objectives.
