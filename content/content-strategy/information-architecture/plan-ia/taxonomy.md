A taxonomy is a list of agreed terms and words that you can use to categorise content across your digital ecosystem. These words can help you decide what labels to use for your IA, as you structure content around it. 

Use your taxonomy to organise content categories so they’re easy to find. It’s helpful to know what each term means and what it refers to.

Some general types of taxonomy for IA can include terms like:
- users
- products
- services
- how to’s
- providers
- publications

Categorise your taxonomy into a hierarchy of related terms to use for your IA.

Use methods like [card sorting](/content-strategy/information-architecture/ia-tools-techniques/#card-sorting) or keyword research to build your taxonomy. Find out common terms and words from your subject experts and business objectives.
