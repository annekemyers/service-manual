### [2]Main menu and IA depth
When mapping out your main menu items, best practice is no more than 7. However, larger sites may need more. Decide this based on the needs of the content and the user. 

Donâ€™t hide something in an unrelated section just to keep your number of top level sections low.

Try to make your headings stand alone. They should make sense when seen out of context of the whole IA.

### [2]Full menus vs partial menus
Menus in some instances can present too many calls to action which in turn can confuse a user. You may not need to make the full menu available at all times. 

User research may show that once a user visits a section of your website, they may not visit another. Rather than make a full menu always available, consider isolating content for a particular task and reducing menu items.
